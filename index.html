                  <p class="u-text u-text-2" spellcheck="false">Tennis swings are extremely technical, as good technique is key to finding the balance of power and finesse required to play well. Traditionally, much of swing analysis has been done by eye. Coaches stand off to the side and watch the swing’s smoothness, the contact point, and follow through. Additionally, players tend to adjust their swing based on the feel of their previous swings. Advanced players may use assistive technology to help improve their technique further, such as slow motion cameras. This process is slow, prone to human error, and requires a skilled coach. This kind of training can be prohibitively expensive, with private lessons often reaching over $100/hour (James).<br>
                  </p>
                  <h6 class="u-text u-text-3"> That’s why we built the Forehand Fixing Tool.</h6>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-4" spellcheck="false">The purpose of this project is to automatically analyze tennis swings based on IMU data taken from the tennis player’s arm. Using hardware nearly every player already owns and an inexpensive mount, we can provide coaching in real time for free. We are looking for two key insights: swing power and swing smoothness. Swing power helps determine the strength of the hit, and swing smoothness helps determine both the efficiency of the swing.</p>

                          <p class="u-text u-text-3" spellcheck="false">Without going into too much detail, forehands have these distinct parts: the backswing, contact, and follow-through.

                            <br>Our proof of concept meets our goals of delivering affordable, automated analysis by using a smartphone and readily available armband. We used a smartphone collecting acceleration and orientation data through the MATLAB mobile app. Although the placement is not ideal from an analysis perspective, a smartphone is too heavy for a player to wear on their forearm without negatively impacting their swing. As a result, we decided to improve our algorithm to deal with this challenge to keep the user experience optimal. For the sake of our proof-of-concept, it was necessary to manually identify the time windows for each swing. However, we believe it would be possible to determine this programmatically with further research.<br><i></i><i></i>

            <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2" spellcheck="false">Before collecting our data, we considered the potential analysis we could perform and how the motion would be captured. We realized that if we wanted to capture a full swing without forcing the player to modify their swing, Our only option was to collect 3 axes of acceleration and 3 axes of orientation data. We had an understanding of how the motion occurs in 3D space, which makes more sense than the motion relative to the smartphone. This meant that we would have to change coordinate spaces so the orientation data was a must. This also informed our mounting solution. Although we initially hoped to capture data from the forearm, our priorities were reducing impact on the player and preventing rotation due to slippage.<br>
              <br>Based on watching each other swing&nbsp; without the sensor a few times, We expected the swing to exist in the 0.5 Hz range. We also observed that it was a somewhat looping motion which made us optimistic there would be clear patterns in the frequency domain. Our key insight comparing swings was that less confident swings would often pause or adjust throughout. This is why we expected a smooth FFT to correspond to a clean, smooth swing.<br>
              <br>Other aspects of the swing we expected to see in the velocity and acceleration data were spinand power. We understood that topspin is created by the upward motion of the racket, and saw this in action comparing hits with and without heavy spin. Power, unsurprisingly would be linked to the speed of the racket at impact.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>This initial analysis drove our design for the Shot Score and selection of subscores. However, after collecting data we realized we had committed a major source of error: the players steps. Based on the footage, we observed this to occur in even lower frequencies than the swing. We updated our analysis to include a high pass filter, and that that it successfully removed the issues we were experiencing.

        <p class="u-text u-text-2" spellcheck="false"> No matter where you mount the sensors, a good tennis swing requires rotation. As we discussed in our motion model, this makes it impossible to fully understand our motion based on acceleration data alone. Luckily, any smartphone or IMU sold today has sensors capable of measuring the device’s orientation.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>To account for orientation changes, our algorithm transforms the acceleration data into the global coordinate frame. To do this, at each timestep we construct a 3D rotation matrix based on the orientation sensor data. In reality, the orientation sensor is a virtual sensor that calculates the device's orientation based on sensor fusion of different IMU sensors (Google). This is valuable because it results in the device’s orientation being reported relative to the gravity vector, so it can be used to find the global coordinate system(). Then, we are able to transform the acceleration vectors from the phone’s coordinate system to the global coordinate system using matrix multiplication.

                        <br>After transforming to the global coordinate system, the different axes begin to look more distinguishable. This is what we would expect because the player's arm motion is not the same in every axis.<br>
                        <br>However, there are still two misleading aspects of our data. Even in this drill, players have a tendency to drift slightly from their starting position. There is also a constant acceleration due to gravity. To isolate the motion of the swing, we want to remove these effects. There are many ways to accomplish this, ranging from the delightful simple to the unreasonably complex. Thankfully, the simple solution exists in the signal processing we have been learning.

Because we only had one accelerometer mounted to the upper arm, we aren’t capturing the movement of the elbow. While we originally proposed using this data to detect early causes of tennis elbow, we weren’t able to mount a sensor in a way to measure the motion that would cause tennis elbow (forearm movement), as our trials led to a lot of twisting and movement which were very difficult to secure. Another implication of our sensor placement is that we do not have a full picture of the motion of the racket. For most purposes the racket position can be determined from wrist position and orientation. However, this is not possible using the arm mount because the forearm can move independently of the upper arm.<br>
                    <br>We account for the fact that players are constantly moving by using a high pass filter to remove frequencies outside of the range of a swing (below 0.25 Hz). In drills like we studied, players are not rapidly repositioning. However, in a match or more complex drill, complex and rapid footwork is expected. This would potentially fall into the frequency range we are analyzing.<br>

Many athletes already have fitness trackers with the same sensor package found in a smartphone. A wearable device would be more comfortable and allow us to get data from the wrist for deeper analysis. Using a wearable device would also allow the app to collect video from the player's smartphone. This would allow them to see the sensor data overlaid with video of their swing to help them visualize the score.<br>
                    <br>We would also like to move beyond forehands. The same analysis could be applied to other shots as well as serves. Notably, Apple has recently been advertising the ability to perform a more primitive analysis of serves than what we present using the Apple Watch. For serves in particular, we believe the wrist mounted sensor would be necessary to fully understand the motion. Most of the movement in a serve is found in the rotation and snapping of the forearm; the upper arm is motionless during the peak of the serve.<br>
                    <br>To bring this concept to market, we would want to follow the route of using a wrist mounted smartwatch or fitness tracker combined with wireless sensors on the torso and upper arm with a smartphone recording video. The wireless sensors could be built using an IMU and a microcontroller with wireless capabilities for less than $10 in materials<b></b>allowing us to deliver a more complete solution without losing sight of our goal to deliver affordable, automated tennis coaching. This would allow us to get the best image of the players motion and fully recreate the motion of their dominant arm and body. It would also allow us to completely isolate the motion of the arm for our analysis. Additionally, we could perform analysis in real time using mobile processing instead of transferring the data to a PC.<br>
