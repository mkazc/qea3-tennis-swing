                  <p class="u-text u-text-2" spellcheck="false">Tennis swings are extremely technical, as good technique is key to finding the balance of power and finesse required to play well. Traditionally, much of swing analysis has been done by eye. Coaches stand off to the side and watch the swing’s smoothness, the contact point, and follow through. Additionally, players tend to adjust their swing based on the feel of their previous swings. Advanced players may use assistive technology to help improve their technique further, such as slow motion cameras. This process is slow, prone to human error, and requires a skilled coach. This kind of training can be prohibitively expensive, with private lessons often reaching over $100/hour.<br>
                  </p>
                  <h6 class="u-text u-text-3"> That’s why we built the Forehand Fixing Tool.</h6>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-4" spellcheck="false">The purpose of this project is to automatically analyze tennis swings based on IMU data taken from the tennis player’s arm. Using hardware nearly every player already owns and an inexpensive mount, we can provide coaching in real time for free. We are looking for two key insights: swing power and swing smoothness. Swing power helps determine the strength of the hit, and swing smoothness helps determine both the efficiency of the swing.</p>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-black u-text-2" spellcheck="false">The biggest limitation to the prototype we assembled is the data available to us. Because we only had one accelerometer mounted to the upper arm, we aren’t capturing the movement of the elbow. While we originally proposed using this data to detect early causes of tennis elbow, we weren’t able to mount a sensor in a way to measure the motion that would cause tennis elbow (forearm movement), as our trials led to a lot of twisting and movement which were very difficult to secure. Another implication of our sensor placement is that we do not have a full picture of the motion of the racket. For most purposes the racket position can be determined from wrist position and orientation. However, this is not possible using the arm mount because the forearm can move independently of the upper arm.<br>
                    <br>We account for the fact that players are constantly moving by using a high pass filter to remove frequencies outside of the range of a swing (below 0.25 Hz). In drills like we studied, players are not rapidly repositioning. However, in a match or more complex drill, complex and rapid footwork is expected. This would potentially fall into the frequency range we are analyzing.<br>

Many athletes already have fitness trackers with the same sensor package found in a smartphone. A wearable device would be more comfortable and allow us to get data from the wrist for deeper analysis. Using a wearable device would also allow the app to collect video from the player's smartphone. This would allow them to see the sensor data overlaid with video of their swing to help them visualize the score.<br>
                    <br>We would also like to move beyond forehands. The same analysis could be applied to other shots as well as serves. Notably, Apple has recently been advertising the ability to perform a more primitive analysis of serves than what we present using the Apple Watch. For serves in particular, we believe the wrist mounted sensor would be necessary to fully understand the motion. Most of the movement in a serve is found in the rotation and snapping of the forearm; the upper arm is motionless during the peak of the serve.<br>
                    <br>To bring this concept to market, we would want to follow the route of using a wrist mounted smartwatch or fitness tracker combined with wireless sensors on the torso and upper arm with a smartphone recording video. The wireless sensors could be built using an IMU and a microcontroller with wireless capabilities for less than $10 in materials<b> [SOURCES!!!!] </b>allowing us to deliver a more complete solution without losing sight of our goal to deliver affordable, automated tennis coaching. This would allow us to get the best image of the players motion and fully recreate the motion of their dominant arm and body. It would also allow us to completely isolate the motion of the arm for our analysis. Additionally, we could perform analysis in real time using mobile processing instead of transferring the data to a PC.<br>
